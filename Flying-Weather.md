# Flying Weather

## Clouds

Normal clouds are classified into two categories:

* `Convective clouds` or `Cumuliform clouds` (Cu)
* `Layer clouds` or `Stratiform clouds` (St)

### Convective Clouds

Cumuliform clouds, `Cu`, look like stacks of cotton balls.

* Form when warm humid air rises through cooler surrounding air in the atmosphere.
* The buoyancy associated with the warm air drives strong updrafts

Convective clouds often have relatively flat bases that are somewhat near to the ground. However, the vertical depth of the clouds can vary significantly. Theses clouds come in 4 sizes:

1. Small: `cumulus humilis` (Cu hum) = `fair weather cumulus`
2. Medium: `cumulus mediocris` (Cu med)
3. Large: `cumulus congestus` (Cu cong) = `towering cumulus` (TCu)
4. Extra large: `cumulonimbus` (Cb) = `thunderstorms`

![cumuliform](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01a-clouds/images-01a/images-cu/cu-diagram-Stull.png)

#### Where do they form?

Convective clouds form wherever the air near the ground is colder than the ground of ocean-surface. This can happen:

* Behind `cold fronts`
  * where a warm air mass is forced upwards by collision with a cold air mass
* On mostly clear days when sunshine warms the ground more than the overlying air
* Over urban and industrial centers that are warmer than the surrounding rural areas
* When cold air blows over a warmer ocean or lake, or warmer land

#### Local Effects

All size cumulus clouds have an updraft that starts near ground level and extends up into the cloud all the way to the cloud top:

* birds and sailplane pilots intentionally circle in the updrafts to get a free lift to higher altitude

Between the updrafts are weaker downdrafts of clear air:

* airplane and helicopter pilots flying at a constant altitude belown cloud base would feel a bumpy ride as they fly through the up- and down-drafts.

At the earth's surface, the downdrafts of air hitting the ground cause windgusts that sailors can see as slightly rougher, darker-looking patches of water called `cat's paws`. Similar gusts over pastures and grain crops can cause wavy fields of grain.

#### Hazards

Deeper cumuliform clouds have stronger updrafts.

* The deepest ones, `cumulus congestus` and `thunderstorms`, have such violent updrafts that can be a hazard to aircraft.
* The strong updrafts can cause the pilot to lose control of the aircraft, or can over-stress the aircraft, causing things to break
* The medium and smaller cumulus can be flown under and through, but will cause a bumpy ride
  * be sure to have your seat belt fastened, and provide barf bags to your passengers

### Stratiform Clouds

Layer clouds, `St`, look like sheets or blankets.

* range from only 100m to 6km thick in the vertical
* have a horizontal extent of 100km to 1000km
* associated with layers in the atmosphere with different relative tempratures

When a horizontal wind moves warmer air toward cold wedge at ground level, the warm air slides up along the top surface of the cold air. This behaviour is typical of `warm fronts`. As the warm air rises, it gradually cools to the point where water vapour can condense and make clouds. Indeed, we often find stratiform clouds along warm fronts.

Stratiform clouds are classifed by their altitude, and are grouped into 3 catagories:

1. High: `cirrus` (Ci), `cirrostratus` (Cs), and `cirrocumulus` (Cc)
2. Middle: `altostratus` (As) and `altocumulus` (Ac)
3. Low: `stratus` (St) and `nimbostratus` (Ns)

![stratiform](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01a-clouds/images-01a/images-st/st-diagram-stull.png)

* As a warm front approaches you, you normally see the high clouds first. These clouds extend many hundreds of kilometers ahead of the front, so you see them about half a day before the warm front arrives. 
* Next comes the mid-level clouds, and finally the low clouds along with drizzle or light rain/snow

![warmfront-stratiform-clouds](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01a-clouds/images-01a/images-st/warm-front-clouds.png)

#### Stratus vs. Nimbostratus

They both have low cloud bases, and by eye appear equally dark. 

1. But `nimbostratus` clouds are precipitating (snow, mist, drizzle, or light rain), while `stratus` is not.
2. `nimbostratus` clouds often have diffuse cloud bases, while `stratus` clouds often have well defined cloud bases.

#### Hazards

Flying through stratiform clouds is often a smooth ride because they are not usually turbulent. But, inside any cloud, including stratiform clouds, pilots need to be flying on instruments because they cannot see the ground or landmarks.

If the stratiform clouds are cold enough (at temperatures just below freezing), ice can form on the leading edges of the aircraft due to the quick freezing of supercooled liquid water drops.

Also, soarplane pilots usually don't like stratiform clouds because they shade the ground and prevent thermal updrafts from forming.

### Stratocumulus

The don't fit well in the normal cumuliform or stratiform groups, and they have characteristics of both groups.

## Special Clouds

### Clouds in unstable air aloft

#### Castellanus

**Summary**: Look like small castle turrets.

* are a clue that the atmosphere is becoming unstable
* thunderstorms possible later in the day
* bumpy if you are flying the that cloud layer
* but smooth air above and below it

![castellanus-clouds](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01b-special-clouds/images-01b/images-castellanus/cas5.jpg)
A thin layer of cold air will form above a thin layer of warm air. This combination of layers are said to be `statically unstable`:

* As the warm air rises and the cold air sinks within this warm-cold-air sandwich, mineature convective clouds form in the rising air if enough water vapour is present.
* These clouds look like castle turrets, which is how they get their name `castellanus`.
* Sometimes they form out of the top of a layer of clouds, hence, they are a type of `stratiform cloud`.
* Their diameter is small, compared to their altitude above ground.
* The convective circulations of these clouds do not touch the ground
  * instead are contained within that warm-cold-air sandwich layer.

Castellanus clouds can form as:

* high-altitude clouds
  `cirrus castellanus`, or `cirrocumulus castellanus`
* mid-altitude clouds
  `altocumulus castellanus`
* low-altitude clouds
  `stratocumulus castellanus`

##### Tips for Pilots

* Instrument-rated pilots should avoid flying in a layer of castellanus clouds.
  * as it would likely be turbulent
* If you accidentally find yourself in a layer of castellanus cloud, usually climbing or descending a small distance will get you out of the layer of turbulence.
* Pilots can use these clouds as a clue that the atmosphere contains some instability, which can allow thunderstorms to form more easily later in the day.
  * Storm chasers like castellanus clouds for this reason
  * But a layer of castellanus clouds does not guarantee that thunderstorms will form later.
* These clouds are of little use to sailplane pilots, because sustained updrafts are not often found in the clear air below these clouds.

#### Billow (K-H wave) clouds

**Summary**:

* indicate `wind shear` and `clear-air turbulence (CAT)` at aircraft altitudes
  * wind shear: change of wind speed or direction
  * clear-air turbulence (CAT): moderate to strong bumps
* smoother air is often above and below the layer of billow clouds

![k-h-wave-clouds](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01b-special-clouds/images-01b/images-billow/billow1.jpg)

Wind shear in the atmosphere can cause waves to form in a layer of air where cooler air underlies warmer air. These waves are called `Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) waves`.

* do not need mountains to form
* waves have relatively short wavelengths and are relatively thin
* probably occur very often in the atmosphere, but visible only rarely
  * visible when the rising cool air is relatively humid
  * under the correct conditions, parallel bands of clouds form in the crest of each wave.
  * to a viewer on the ground, these parallel bands of clouds look like billows of an accordion
* the waves often break, causing that cloud layer to become turbulent
* while the waves are breaking, cat's eye swirls form, some of which are even visible on radar
* Pilots prefer to avoid flying at these altitudes because of the turbulence induced by wind shear.

Because these waves happen in large horizontal regions, you can often see billow clouds as a high-cloud layer, or as mid-cloud layer. (`stratiform cloud`)

### Clouds associated with strong winds across mountains

![mountain-wind](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01b-special-clouds/images-01b/Clouds-mountains.png)

#### Lenticular (mountain-wave) Clouds

**Summary**: Indicate vertical wind oscillations and possible mountain-wave turbulence.

* sailplanes like the updraft portion of the waves
  * because they can surf the wave and fly very long horizontal distances
* commercial aircraft hate the waves because they often mean a very bumpy ride at all altitudes for the whole time while flying over the mountains.

These clouds form in the crests of `mountain waves (lee waves)` if the air is relatively humid. If there are several humid layers of air at different altitudes, then you can se a stack of lenticular clouds that look like stacked dinner plates, or like UFOs (flying saucers).

* in a nutshell, if winds hit mountains, then the air is forced to rise over the mountain.
* on the downwind (lee) side, the air returns back down to its starting altitude.
* but due to inertia, it overshoots further down, and then overshoots up again, etc.
* the air is carried downwind while it is oscillating, so it traces the path of wave。

In the upward-moving portion of the wave, the air cools to the point where clouds form. But when the air descends back down the lee side of the wave, the air warms and the clouds evaporate. Thus, these clouds are weird because they remain stationary relative to the mountain while the wind blows through the cloud. 

For this reason, the clouds are often known as `standing lenticular clouds` because they stand still over the mountain. This is one of the few types of cloud that you can fly through sideways in an airplane, as the wind blows the aircraft into and then out of the cloud.

For the first wave, which is over the mountain, the lenticular cloud is often called a `cap cloud`, because it is like a hat or cap on the mountain.

* Pilots flying across these waves experience updrafts and then downdrafts
  * so it takes more effort to maintain a constant flight altitude.
* But if conditions are right, these waves can cause severe mountain wave turbulence, from the earth's surface all the way up into the stratosphere.
* For the gentler waves, sailplane pilots seek the upwind side of the lenticular clouds because they can have nearly continuous updrafts there.

#### Rotor Clouds

**Summary**: Indicate severe or extreme turbulence at low altitudes due to mountain waves.

* The rotors can break off aircraft wings and cause pilots to lose control of their aircraft during take-off and landing.
* Can also affect sailors if the rotors occur over water (lakes or coastal regions) downwind of mountains.

`Rotor clouds` are turbulent, ragged-looking clouds that form at low altitude under the crests of mountain waves. They rotate about a horizontal axis parallel to the mountain range.

* They are associated with violent turbulence that can break wings off of aircraft
* their strong up- and down-drafts can cause pilots of small aircraft to crash while attempting to land and take off.

#### Banner Clouds
**Summary**: Form on downwind side of mountain peak. Indicate strong turbulence touching the downwind side of a tall, isolated mountain peak.

### Clouds formed by extra heat, updrafts, or tubulence

#### Pyrocumulus

`cumulus flammagenitus`

**Summary**: Form over forest fires and volcanoes. Indicate a forest fire so strong that the heat and moisture released can make a thunderstorm in the smoke.

#### Pileus

**Summary**: Form over fast-growing cumulus clouds. Interesting to watch, but they are harmless, and don't affect flying, sailing or snow sports.

#### Fractus / scud

**Summary**: Form in turbulent humid air near the ground. These scud clouds indicate high humidity (such as due to drizzle falling from higher clouds) and strong winds at low altitude.

### Clouds fored by humans (i.e., homogenitus)

![homogenitus](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01b-special-clouds/images-01b/Clouds-anthropogenic-others.png)

#### Fumulus

`cumulus homogenitus`

**Summary**: Water-droplet clouds over cooling towers. Interesting to see, though harmless for flying, sailing, or snow sports.

#### Contrails

`cirrus homogenitus`

**Summary**: Aircraft condensation trail. Indicate the turbulent wing-tip vortices behind aircraft. Small aircraft can be flipped upside down if they accidently fly into a wing-tip vortex. Military pilots hate contrails, because they reveal the aircraft to the enemy.

## Cloud Coverage

Pilots flying visually, `VFR`, must stay outside of clouds. Even those flying in instruments, `IFR`, are concerned if there is a low overcast (a low ceiling) over their destination airport. For this reason, cloud coverage is important to pilots.

The fraction of sky covered by cloud is called `sky cover`, `cloud cover`, or `cloud amount`. It's measured in eights, `oktas`, according to the World Meteorological Organization, `WMO`.

![sky-cover](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01c-cloud_coverage/images-01c/cloud_cover_table-v2.png)

For aviation, the altitude of cloud base for the lowest cloud with coverage greater than 5 oktas is considered the `ceiling`. (i.e. lowest `broken` or `overcast` clouds).

Sometimes the sky is `obscured`, meaning that there might be clouds but the observer on the ground cannot see them. For obscurations, the `vertical visibility` (VV) distance is reported as a ceiling instead.

The cloudiness looks greater than it actually is when observing at oblique angles (or from the ground).

### How observers on the ground try to estimate sky cover by eye

A tricky aspect of estimating cloud cover is that lower-altitude clouds block the view of higher-altitude clouds that might or might not really be there. 

* To be conservative (i.e. extra safe), weather observers should always assume that：
  * if any clouds are visible at mid or higher levels, then clouds at those same levels are assumed to exist even if they are hidden by lower-altitude clouds.

![estimate-sky-cover](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01c-cloud_coverage/images-01c/SkyCoverInterpretation.png)

### Cloud coverage as viewed from an aircraft

**Caution**: If you are flying at an altitude just above or just below the clouds, then in your slant or oblique view, the sky will look much more overcast than it really is. 

## Ceiling

Pilots flying according to visual flight rules need to see where they are going. But in clouds, you can't see anything — so VFR pilots need to stay out of clouds.

If a layer of clouds covers more than half the sky, then these clouds act like a lid or `ceiling` for VFR aviation, and constrains VFR flights to fly in the clear air below it (with some exceptions).

`ceiling` is the height `above ground level`, AGL, of the lowest cloud base.

* The cloud base is below 20000 ft (6000 m)
* and is covering more than half the sky
  * broken of overcast

Ceilings are reported as a height: e.g. the ceiling is 500 feet above ground level.

Ceiling is reported as the `vertical visibility` within that surface-based poor-visibility layer (in fog, in forest-fire smoke, in a dust storm)

Even pilots flying under instrument flight rules (IFR) are concerned with ceilings, in order to be able to land at airports.

* The reason is that most aircraft and airports are not equiped with the very expensive equipment that allows aircraft to completely land themselves using the autopilot (known as a Category IIIc approach). Instead, the IFR pilot that is descending through a cloud layer needs to pop out below the cloud base at a high enough altitude to allow sufficient time to look around, find the appropriate runway at the airport, align the aircraft with the runway, and land safely.

**Ceilings are measured with**:

* Traditional ceilometers
  Use a searchlight (ceiling projector) at an angle relative to vertical to shine on the cloud base.  Change the angle until the illuminated spot on the cloud is directly above a detector that is a known distance from the spotlight.  Then use trigonometry to calculate cloud-base height.
* Laser ceilometers
  Send up a burst of light, and measure how long it takes the light from cloud base to reflect back.
* Ceiling balloons
  Watch a red helium-filled latex balloon as it rises, record the balloon flight time until it disappears into the cloud, and then calculate the ceiling altitude based on typical rise rates of those balloons.
* Pilot reports
  Ascending planes after take-off or descending planes approaching to land can report their altitude when they passed through cloud base.
* Weather-observer estimates
  These are the worst estimates, because it is difficult to judge distance by eye, UNLESS the estimates are from tall towers or mountain tops that stick up into the clouds.

Because ceilings and visibility are so closely related, and because they are the primary considerations for whether a flight can be VFR or must be IFR, they are sometimes reported together.

* CAVOK = Ceiling and Visibility are OK (i.e. good for VFR flight)

## Visibility

If you hear the word "visibility" without any adjectives in front, then assume it is a horizontal visibility.

### Horizontal Visibility

For Canadian aviation, visibility is reported in statute miles over land, and nautical miles over the ocean. US aviation uses statute miles. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommends kilometres or metres.

If the visibility is poor, then pilots will have difficulty seeing:

* the ground, for landmarks for navigation
* other aircraft or obstacles (such as tall towers), so they don't hit them
* the horizon, to help them keep the plane flying level
* the runway at an airport, for landing

The time between when the pilot first sees an obstacle and when the aircraft hits it depends on the visibility. 

* If visibility is good and exceeds a certain threshold, then the pilot is allowed to fly under the `Visual Flight Rules` (VFR)
* when visibility is poor, only specially-trained pilots flying aircraft with special instruments can fly, on `instrument flight rules` (IFR), and following specific directions given by `air traffic control`

### Measuring Visibility

* Human observers often estimate visibility by trying to see landmarks of known distances from the airport, such as tall towers, mountains, trees, or smoke stacks.
* Some automated instruments, `ransmissometers`, shine an incident light beam across a known path length (e.g. 250 feet), and measure how much dimmer the received (transmitted*) light is compared to when the air is clean.
* Other instruments measure how much light is scattered from tiny particles in the air.

### Runway Visual Range (RVR)

Indicates how far ahead a pilot can see horizontally along a runway centerline. Reported only when visibilities are poor.

### Vertical Visibility (VV)

Vertical visibility is determined by either:

1. The distance that an observer can see vertically into an indefinite ceiling
2. The height corresponding to the top of a ceiling light projector beam
3. The height at which a ceiling balloon (a bright red balloon filled with helium) completely disappears during the presence of an indefinite ceiling
4. The height determined by the sensor algorithm at automated stations (based on horizontal visibility)

## Regulations: VFR vs. IFR

### Visual Flight
`VFR` = `Visual Flight Rules` means that you fly by mostly looking out the window. You need good visibility and need to stay out of clouds. By looking with your eyes, you can:

* navigate, so you can go toward your destination without flying through airspace where you are not allowed
* avoid hitting obstacles, such as mountains, tall towers, or other aircraft
* control the aircraft — namely, see whether it is climbing (nose up), descending (nose down), or turning (banked left or right)
* find airports and land on the appropriate runway

good weather for fly VFR:  `Visual Meteorological Conditions` (VMC) or `Visual Flight Conditions` (VFC)

Pilots with only VFR skills:

* are not trained to interprete and igore their balance signals from their inner ear, or their inertial feelings; the pilot loses control of the aircraft.
* lose track of where they are.
* so scared about their situation that they become irrational, they forget their emergency training, and they make poor decisions.  The result: a bad situation can become worse.

### Marginally Visual Flight

Conditions for which VFR is allowed, but for which visibility is poor and/or cloud-base is low, are called `Marginal VFR` (MVFR).

### Instrument Flight

`IFR` = `Instrument Flight Rules` mean that you can conduct most of the flight by NOT looking out the window. Instead, you:

* navigate using onboard GPS map displays and other navigation signals
* control the aircraft by looking at the instruments on your dashboard (called a "control panel" on aircraft)
* get to airports by following the instructions and clearances given by `air traffic controllers` (ATC) who keep track of your flight and make sure you arrive at your distination without hitting anything
* You are required to file a `flight plan` before you start, so that ATC knows where you want to go.

To fly IFR, you need to:

* be specially trained to believe the instruments and to ignore your normal physiological stimuli like inner-ear signals and "seat of the pants" feelings of pressure or G-forces on your body
* have an aircraft with the proper instruments and radios, all in good working order
* have the proper charts

You can fly IFR in good and in bad weather. Bad weather is called `Instrument Flight Condition` (IFC) or  `Instrument Meteorological Conditions` (IMC)

* i.e. weather for which VFR flight is not allowed.
* IFR pilots must stay out of thunderstorms and out of volcanic ash (which sandblasts the engines, causing them to fail).
* IFR pilots without the right aircraft need to stay out of clouds with supercooled cloud and rain drops.

### VFR Over the Top

`VFR over the top` is when there is a layer of clouds below you, so you cannot see the ground to help you navigate. In many countries you do not need an IFR clearance to fly VFR over the top.

| Category |    Ceiling  | | Visibility     |
| -------- | :---------: |-| :--------------|
|IFR       | cloud base is less than 1000 ft AGL| and/or | less than 3 SM |
|MVFR|cloud base is between 1000 ft and 3000 ft AGL|and/or|between 3 and 5 SM|
|VFR|cloud blase is more than 3000 ft AGL|AND|more than 5 SM|

AGL: above ground level
SM: statute miles

## [Fog](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01h-fog/index.html)

Fog reduces visiblity and makes it difficult to see where you are, where the airport is, and where other airplanes are.

### Fog Formation and Dissipation

Fog is a cloud that touches the ground. The visibility is very poor, usually less than 1 km.

`Freezing Fog`: the fog is made of `supercooled` tiny liquid water droplets
`Ice Fog`: the fog is made of tiny ice crystals

Fog can form due to two mechanisms:
1. when water is added to `unsaturated` air (non-foggy air)
2. when unsaturated air is cooled to its `dew-point temperature`

   * the temperature at which water vapor starts to condense into liquid droplets

Sometimes both mechanisms work together to make or maintain fog. Cooling is common at night, which is why fog is most likely during late night and early morning.

Cool air is denser (heavier) than warm air, so the cool air often flows downhill and settles into valleys. For this reason, many fogs form in low spots or valleys as `valley fog`. Unfortunately, airports are often in valleys.

* On windy nights:
  Fog usually forms when the winds are relatively slow or near calm.
  * if fog already formed at night when winds were light, then the fog will dissipate if the wind speed increases.
* On nights with clear skies
  * If the air is cooled sufficiently, and has sufficiently high humidity, then fog can form.
  * If this humid layer cools enough, then a deep fog layer can form that is difficult to dissipate.
* On nights with substantial cloud cover
  * the clouds prevent the ground from cooling rapidly
  * prevents to make fog

### Types of Fog

`Radiation`: During clear, nearly-calm nights the ground cools by infra-red radiation to space. 
`Advection`: Humid air blows over a colder surface, causing the air temperature to decrease to the dew-point temperature. These fogs can form as thick layers, sometimes with sharp, well-defined front edges.
`Upslope`: When the wind blows air against a hill slope, the air is pushed upward. When the air rises sufficiently high and gets sufficiently cold, then fog can form.
`Precipitation` or `Frontal`: Precipitation fog or frontal fog is formed by adding moisture, via the evaporation from warm rain drops falling down through the initially-unsaturated cooler air below cloud base.
`Steam`: Steam fog occurs when cold air moves over warm humid surfaces such as unfrozen lakes or oceans during early winter. 

### What you can do about fog

Fog is considered to be an `"obscuration"` that reduces `horizontal visibility` to 0.5 statute miles or less.

## [Obscurations](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01i-obscurations/index.html)

### Mist

Mist is when very small precipitation particles are gently falling through the air. 

* Visibility is usually greater than 1 km, as compared to fog, which has lower visibilities.
* Mist can exist in air having a relative humidity between 95% and 100%.
* Mist creates a thin grey-colored partial obscuration.

### Smoke

Smoke can come from factories, cars, and forest fires.

* Even far downwind of forest fires and other wild fires, the smoke is often spread out somewhat uniformly within the bottom several km of the atmosphere.
* Smoke from forest fires and other sources can reduce visibility to the point where it is a hazard to aviation.  Also, if you fly through smoke then you could breathe the toxic fumes that enter the aircraft cockpit or cabin through the aircraft ventillation system. 

### Volcanic Ash

Volcanic ash consists of microscopic rocks with sharp edges. They can cause serious problems to aircraft that accidently fly through the ash clouds.

* If volcanic ash gets in jet/turbine engines, it can not only abrade the turbine components, but can also melt and re-solidify into glass-like coatings and protuberances that cause the turbines to break.
* For this reason, volcanic ash forecast maps are produced for aviation. But they are produced only when the hazard exists.
* Volcanoes also emit lots of gases, such as sulfur dioxide, high into the stratosphere.

### Sand

Strong winds over deserts and sandy regions can create `sand storms`, also called `haboobs`. Some of these haboobs are created by outflow winds from thunderstorms.

### Haze

It consists of microscopic liquid water droplets that form around a pollutant particle or chemical that attracts water vapor.

* the haze particles can grow even when the relative humidity in the air is less than 100%, sometimes as low as 75%.
* quickly grow to a final small size by attracting water vapor out of the air, but they don't keep growing.

Small haze particles are generically known as `aerosols`, which include microscopic solid and liquid particles.

### Spray

Breaking waves cause tiny droplets of sea water to be injected into the atmosphere.

### Dust

These dust particles are smaller than the sand particles of sand storms. Hence, the dust can stay in the air longer after the strong winds end, because the particles gravitationally settle out more slowly.

### Snow and Blowing Snow

A `blizzard` is when there is `blowing snow` in the air with reduced visiblity AND fast wind speeds.

### Rain

Heavy rain can be a problem.

## [Altitude and Pilot Physiology](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/02-met_concepts/02b-oxygen_physiology/index.html)

### Hypoxia

Suffering from an insufficient supply of oxygen. Nonethess, our behavior is goofy. 
Oxygen deficiency

The higher altitude you fly, the shorter your `time-duration of useful consciousness` (TUC)
|Altitude (feet)|Altitude (km)|TUC|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|

**Symptoms**:

* Between 12000 and 15000 feet:
  * Impared/reduced: judgement, memory, alertness, coordination, and ability to make calculations.
  * Headache, drowsiness, dizziness, euporia (happy, carefree), or belligerence (want to start a fight).
* Above 15000:
  * Periphery vision fails (becomes grayed out), leaving you with tunnel vision.
  * Your lips and fingernails become blue (called cyanosis)
  * Eventually unconsciousness and then death.

These symptoms happen more quickly at higher altitudes.

## [Air Density and Density Altitude](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/02-met_concepts/02c-density_altitude/)

Airplanes need a certain air density in order to fly. At lower density there is less air flowing over the wings, so the wings get less lift.

If the density is lower, then the aircraft will need a longer runway to take-off, and once it takes-off, it will climb (gain altitude) more slowly.

### Density Altitude

Density altitude is the theoretical altitude in a standard atmosphere for which the air has the same density as at your actual altitude in a non-standard atmosphere.

* Lower pressure, higher altitude, and warmer temperatures cause a higher "density altitude".
* Higher density altitudes indicate poorer aircraft performance.
  * Poorer performance means you need longer runway to take off, your aircraft will climb more slowly ...

## [Crosswinds vs. Headwinds](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/02-met_concepts/02d-crosswind/index.html)

`Headwind`: A wind directly in your face that slows you down
`Tailwind`: A wind from directly behind you

* Tailwinds are often good during most of the trip, because you can go faster, allowing you to get to your estination sooner
* However, for aircraft on an airport runway, tailwinds are bad because the aircraft needs more runway to take off and to land

### Airports, Winds, and Runway Orientation

Aircraft try to land and takeoff into the wind (i.e., a headwind) because they don't need so much runway length.

**Summary**:

* tailwinds are bad on take-off and landing, but are good in flight.
* headwinds are good on take-off and landing, but are bad in flight.
* After take-off with the nice headwind, then they turn to the desired heading toward their destination.
* On take-off and landing, crosswinds are difficult
* Thus, for any wind direction, hopefully one of the runways is aligned close enough to the wind direction to have a good headwind and minimal crosswind. 

## [Wind Shear at Aerodrmoes (Airports)](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/02-met_concepts/02e-shear_at_aerodromes/index.html)

### What is Wind Shear

* The change of wind speed and/or wind direction with altitude.
* Wind shear can happen at any altitude
* Wind shear is almost always present near the ground
* and the shear is stronger when the near-surface wind speeds are faster
* strong wind shear near the ground at airports makes it difficult to land and take off.

### What Causes Wind Shear

1. Caused by weather systems
   1. [`Synoptic-scale` shear](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/02-met_concepts/02e-shear_at_aerodromes/synoptic-shear.html)
   associated with low-pressure centers, fronts, and strong surface winds
   Winds are usually stronger around low-pressure centers (lows) than around highs.
   Lows and Fronts
   synoptic, synoptic scale, lows, highs, fronts, cold front, warm front, isobar
   2. Convective shear caused by thunderstorm downbursts, microbursts, and gust fronts.
2. Caused by wind flowing across mountains
   1. Mountain-wave shear (including rotors) downwind of mountains.
   2. Channeling of winds through valleys and mountain passes ([gap winds](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/02-met_concepts/02e-shear_at_aerodromes/gap-winds.html))
   fjords, straits, gap winds, barrier jet
   3. Mountain [downslope windstorms](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/02-met_concepts/02e-shear_at_aerodromes/downslope_windstorms.html), including chinooks (Foehn) and boras
   dry adiabatic lapse rate, Foehn, Chinook, bora, mountain waves, downslope windstorm, foehn wall
3. Associated with turbulence behind obstacles (trees, buildings, mountains).
4. Caused by other large aircraft and helicoptors that are landing and taking off

Weak wind shears that are not a hazard to aircraft. Local winds winds with weak wind shears: `sea breeze` (or `lake breeze`), `anabatic winds`, and `katabatic winds`.
Although katabatic winds are weak in most parts of the world, they can become very fast.

## [Updrafts for Soaring](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/02-met_concepts/02f-soaring/index.html)

Relate updrafts for soaring to causes including thermals, anabatic winds, and mountain waves

## [Layers in the Standard Atmosphere](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/03-met_concepts/03a-std_atmos/index.html)

![temperature](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/03-met_concepts/03a-std_atmos/images-03a/std-atmos-temperature-color.png)

* `Troposphere`: almost all of our weather occur in the troposphere. The top of the troposhpere is called the `tropopause` ("trope").
  * the troposhpere is thinner during winter and thinner near the poles
  * All light aircraft fly in the troposphere.
* `Stratosphere`: The top of the stratosphere is called the `stratopause`.
  * Many modern commercial aircraft fly in the lower stratosphere to get above most of the storms and weather that are in the troposphere.
* `Mesosphere`: The top of the mesosphere is called the `mesopause`.
* `Thermosphere`, `Exosphere`

## [Static Stability and Atmospheric Soundings](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/03-met_concepts/03b-static-stability/index.html)

If atmospheric structure is such that the cool (heavy) layer of air is under the warmer (lighter) layer, then that part of the atmosphere is said to be statically stable.

In statically stable conditions:

* Typically forms near the ground at night under clear skies with calm-to-light winds, when the ground temperature decreases, and the ground cools the air that touches it.
* Air is usually nonturbulent (a smooth ride in an airplane) if there is no wind shear.
* But if this air is forced up over a mountain, then on the downwind side it sinks past its starting altitude (i.e., overshoots downward), and then starts to rise again and overshoots upward, and keeps oscillating as a mountain wave.
* Cold air near the ground can drain downhill and can pool in the valley floor, where frost or fog can form in the cold air.
* If there is wind shear in a statically stable region, then turbulence can form, along with breaking atmospheric waves called Kelvin Helmholtz waves

In statically neutral conditions:

* Typically forms in overcast conditions (day or night) when the wind is moderate or strong.
* Air can be nonturbulent, but the slightest wind shear can create dynamic instability and turbulence.
* Neutral air hitting a mountain creates obstacle wake turbulence downwind of the mountain.

In statically unstable conditions:

* Typically occurs in sunny days over land when the average winds are relatively light.  
* It can be caused when the sun heats the land and the land warms the bottom layer of air.
* Thermals of warm air rise with cooler descending air between the thermals.
* Cumulus clouds might form at the top of the thermals if the thermals are humid enough and the unstable air is deep enough.
* If the unstable air extends over most of the depth of the troposphere, then thunderstorms can form (with many flight hazards).

### Temperature Soundings (Upper air Soundings)

To determine the stability, we need weather conditions at many different heights. This is called a `sounding`.
Most countries have national weather services that launch weather ballons called `rawinsondes`

## [Turbulence Hazards to Aviation](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/03-met_concepts/03c-turb_intensity/index.html)

`Turbulence` is the random gusty fluctuations (vertical & horizontal) of the wind. Turbulence usually consists of many different size swirls of air motion (called `eddies`) superimposed on each other.

### Turbulence Intensities

NavCanada Aviation Weather Services Guide Turbulence Reporting Table
|Intensity|Aircraft Reaction|Inside Aircraft|
|:-:|:-|:-|
Light|Slight erratic changes (turbulence); Slight rhythmic changed (chop)|Slight strain against seat belts; Little or no difficulty walking
Moderate|Changes to altitude/attitude but aircraft remains in control; Rapid bumps or jolts (chop)|Definite strain against seat belts; Objects are dislodged; Difficulty walking
Severe|Large, abrupt changes in altitude/attitude and airspeed; Momentarily out of control|Forced violently against seat belts; Walking is impossible; Unsecured objects thrown about

### How Turbulence Forms

Natural turbulence can be created by 3 different processes:

* `convective turbulence`, or `free convection`, or `thermal turbulence` (due to buoyancy: warm air rising and cold air sinking)
* `wind-shear turbulence`, or `forced convection`, or `mechanical turbulence` (different wind speeds or wind directions at different altitudes)
* `obstacle turbulence` (caused by wind hitting an object and flowing around it).  The wakes behind fixed objects such as mountains will be discussed here.

## [Mountain Waves](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/03-met_concepts/03d-mountain_waves/index.html)

`Mountain waves` are wavy motions of the air caused when statically stable air flows over mountains.

The air has a "`natural wavelength`" that depends on M and S.

* Faster wind speeds (M) create longer wavelengths.  
* Greater static stability (S) creates shorter wavelengths.
* S = static stability
* M = wind speed

`Froude number` (Fr): The ratio of natural wavelength to mountain width

* Small Fr << 1: light M and/or strong S; the natural wavelength is shorter than the mountain width
  causing weak mountain waves downwind of the mountain range
* Fr = 1: causes the most violent waves with strongest up and downdrafts
  the natural wavelength of the wave matches the width of the mountain.
* Large Fr >> 1: causes weaker amplitude, longer wavelength waves
  a region of reversed wind flow near the ground close to the mountain
* Fr = infinity: strong turbulent wakes behind the mountain, but not much mountain waves.

If there is a layer of humid air near the altitude of the mountain wave, then sometimes a cloud called a `lenticular cloud` or `mountain wave cloud` or `lee-wave cloud` will form.

But most mountain waves do not form lenticular clouds.

`Rotor clouds` indicates extremely violent turbulence with up and downward motions that can exceed the climb speed of the aircraft.

## [Clear-air Turbulence (CAT)](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/03-met_concepts/03e-CAT/index.html)

`clear-air turbulence (CAT)`: wind-shear turbulence happens outside of (and not near) a thunderstorm cloud

CAT can happen at any altitude, but is often the most intense where the winds are strongest, such as near the jet stream. If you encounter CAT, you can often get out of it by climbing or descending to a different altitude.

`Jet stream`: a region of fast winds at the same altitudes that commercial airliners fly.

## [Boundary Layer and Obstacle/Mountain Turbulence](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/03-met_concepts/03f-BL_obstacle_wake/index.html)

This layer of the atmosphere is called the `atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)` = `planetary boundary layer (PBL)`, and turbulence in this layer is called `boundary-layer turbulence`.

Boundary layer turbulence is often weak to moderate — not usually a hazard to aircraft, but bumpy enough to make passengers airsick.

ABL turbulence is often nonexistent, or sometimes weak and sporadic, at night when winds are light.

These thermals often carry air pollutants upward

These daytime thermals are places where sailplane pilots like to soar because of the lift. 

## [Aircraft Icing](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/03-met_concepts/03g-Icing/index.html)

supercooled liquid droplets freeze almost instantly when they touch something solid and cold such as an airplane

## [Frontal Hazards](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/03-met_concepts/03h-frontal_hazards/index.html)

`Front`: the boundary between warmer and cooler air
`Cold front`: the cold air advances
`Warm front`: the cold air retreats
`Stationary front`: the boundary doesn't move very much
`Occluded front`: the cold front catches up to and merges with the warm front

Fronts often have clouds, precipitation,  strong winds, and turbulence

`Frontogenesis`: birth of a new front
`Frontolysis`: death of an old front
`Squall line`: line of thunderstorms not along a front

##[Types of Thunderstorms](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/04-met_concepts/04a-Tstorm_types/index.html)

Most thunderstorms are composed of `cells`, where each cell is like an individual thunderstorm. The cell evolution has three stages:

1. Cumulus
   Updrafts, no downdrafts. No rain. No `anvil` (the horizontally-extended upper part of the cloud). Often not visible on radar.
2. Mature
   Both up and downdrafts. Rain. Anvil. Most violent stage. Rain portion of cell is visible on radar.
3. Dissipating
   Downdrafts, no updrafts. Raining itself out, but leaving ice crystals in the middle and upper parts of the cloud. Not very visible on radar.

`Residue`: Not officially listed as a stage, but affects pilots because ice crystals in the anvil take a long time to evaporate. This blocks VFR (visual) flight through that region at the altitude of the anvil cloud.

## [Thunderstorm Hazards to Aviation](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/04-met_concepts/04b-h-Tstorm_hazards/index.html)

Thunderstorms are convective clouds, which means they are driven by the buoyancy of warm rising air inside the cloud.

In North America, thunderstorms and their hazards are most common in Spring and Summer, when warm humid air is triggered to rise along weather boundaries such as cold fronts, sea breezes, dry lines, gust fronts, etc.

All aviation authorities require that you do NOT fly through thunderstorms. The US and Canada recommend that pilots stay at least 20 nautical miles away from thunderstorms.

Also, civilian pilots should NOT try to fly over the tops of thunderstorms

## [Convective Turbulence](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/04-met_concepts/04b-h-Tstorm_hazards/1-conv_turb.html)

### What if I fly into a thunderstorm cloud?

* The largest-size updrafts and downdrafts would move your whole aircraft upward or downward away from your assigned altitude
* The medium-size eddies would cause 
  * intense and random rolling motions 
  the aircraft wings bank right and left
  * pitching motions
  the aircraft nose is rocked up and down
  * yawing motions
  the aircraft nose is rocked left and right
* The smaller eddies would cause violent shaking, similar to what you would feel in a car driving over a very bumpy road

All of these motions would happen simultaneously, causing a very rough ride and making the aircraft very difficult to control.

## [Downbursts, Microbursts, Gust Fronts & Low-Level Wind Shear](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/04-met_concepts/04b-h-Tstorm_hazards/2-downbursts-gustfronts.html)

`Downbursts`: rapidly descending downdrafts of air, found below clouds that have precipitation or `virga`.

The downbusts form when falling raindrops pass through drier air en route to the ground

Sometimes the downdraft speeds can be so fast that they are a hazard to aircraft. These fast downdrafts of air from thunderstorms are called downbursts, and can be 1 to 10 km in diameter. Those damaging downbursts with a small diameter (0.5 to 4 km) and short duration (2 to 5 minutes) are called `microbursts`.

The air spreads out as `outflow winds` in all horizontal directions away from the impact point when the cold downburst air hits the ground. The leading edge of these outrushing winds is called a `gust front`.

gust front advances over an airport -> sudden change of wind speed and direction known as `low-level wind shear` -> making landings and take-offs extremely challenging. if exist sufficient moisture in the air hit by the advancing gust front -> form `arc cloud`: a low-altitude cloud

the gust front could stir up a wall of dust called a `haboob`

Habbob vs. arc cloud:

* haboob touches the ground, and dust or sand is in the turbulent outflow air
* arc cloud doesn't touch the ground, and consists of cloud droplets in the pre-gust-front warm air that was pushed up over the outflow cold thunderstorm air

### Hazards to Aircraft

* A strong downburst can push an aircraft towards the ground, where the aircraft could impact buildings, trees, powerlines, or other structures.
* the radial straight-line winds near an airport can cause wind shifts that make it very difficult to land or take off.
* if an aircraft flies across a gust front, can cause the aircraft to unintentionally climb higher than the desired `glideslope`

if the aircraft approach deviates too much from the desired glideslope, then the pilot will "go around" (doesn't land, but climbs back to the assigned altitude to try again later)

`holding pattern`

## [Lightning & Precipitation Static](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/04-met_concepts/04b-h-Tstorm_hazards/3-lightning-Pstatic.html)

`Lightning`: a long, thin spark created in a thunderstorm
Lightning `stroke` can happen:

* between a cloud and the ground (`cloud-to-ground lightning`, or `CG lightning`)
* between two adjacent clouds
* within a single cloud
* from teh cloud to clear air

Lightning forms due to the collision of small ice crystals and small hailstones (`graupel`) inside a thunderstorm.

* greater voltage build-up in a thunderstorm can cause longer lightning paths

Aircraft do not attract lightning and do not cause lightning.

### Precipitation static (P-Static)

`P-static`: the sparks taht dance on the outside of an aircraft
`St. Elmo's fire`: Sometimes the corona discharge will appear as filaments of light writhing on the outside of the windshield

* The sparks also cause static (crackling sounds) that you hear on the radio.  

## [Hail](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/04-met_concepts/04b-h-Tstorm_hazards/4-hail.html)

`Hailstones`: irregularly-shaped balls of ice, larger than 0.5 cm in diameter, that fall from severe thunderstorms.

* smaller than 0.5 cm: `graupel`

`Hail`: the event or process of hailstones falling out of the sky
`Hail swath`: the damage path on the ground due to a moving hail storm

`TORRO` Hailstone Size Classification
Size Code|Max. Diameter (cm)|Description
:-:|:-:|:-
0|0.5 - 0.9|Pea
1|1.0 - 1.5|Mothball
2|1.6 - 2.0|Marbel, grape
3|2.1 - 3.0|Walnut
4|3.1 - 4.0|Pigeon egg to golf ball
5|4.1 - 5.0|Pullet egg
6|5.1 - 6.0|Hen egg
7|6.1 - 7.5|Tennis ball to cricket ball
8|7.6 - 9.0|Large orange to soft ball
9|9.1 - 10.0|Grapefruit
10|>10.0|Melon

### Why does hail get so large?

### How does hail affect aircraft?

Hail is EXTREMELY dangerous to aircraft.

1. breaks the windscreen
2. dents the leading edges of the wings and tail
3. hail can also damage your aircraft while it is parked

## [Tornadoes](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/04-met_concepts/04b-h-Tstorm_hazards/5-tornadoes.html)

Pilots should NEVER be in or near a tornadic thunderstorm

##[Heavy Rain](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/04-met_concepts/04b-h-Tstorm_hazards/6-heavy_rain.html)

the heaviest part of thunderstorm rain usually happens in isolated showers of diameters ranging from 1 to 15 km, so you can often fly around them. The exception is a `squall line`

Detect heavy rain cells:

* Airborne weather radar
* Ground-based weather radar
* pilot reports
* Visual appearance of showers
