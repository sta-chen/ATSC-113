# Flying Weather

## Clouds

Normal clouds are classified into two categories:

* `Convective clouds` or `Cumuliform clouds` (Cu)
* `Layer clouds` or `Stratiform clouds` (St)

### Convective Clouds

Cumuliform clouds, `Cu`, look like stacks of cotton balls.

* Form when warm humid air rises through cooler surrounding air in the atmosphere.
* The buoyancy associated with the warm air drives strong updrafts

Convective clouds often have relatively flat bases that are somewhat near to the ground. However, the vertical depth of the clouds can vary significantly. Theses clouds come in 4 sizes:

1. Small: `cumulus humilis` (Cu hum) = `fair weather cumulus`
2. Medium: `cumulus mediocris` (Cu med)
3. Large: `cumulus congestus` (Cu cong) = `towering cumulus` (TCu)
4. Extra large: `cumulonimbus` (Cb) = `thunderstorms`

#### Where do they form?

Convective clouds form wherever the air near the ground is colder than the ground of ocean-surface. This can happen:

* Behind `cold fronts`
  * where a warm air mass is forced upwards by collision with a cold air mass
* On mostly clear days when sunshine warms the ground more than the overlying air
* Over urban and industrial centers that are warmer than the surrounding rural areas
* When cold air blows over a warmer ocean or lake, or warmer land

#### Local Effects

All size cumulus clouds have an updraft that starts near ground level and extends up into the cloud all the way to the cloud top:

* birds and sailplane pilots intentionally circle in the updrafts to get a free lift to higher altitude

Between the updrafts are weaker downdrafts of clear air:

* airplane and helicopter pilots flying at a constant altitude belown cloud base would feel a bumpy ride as they fly through the up- and down-drafts.

At the earth's surface, the downdrafts of air hitting the ground cause windgusts that sailors can see as slightly rougher, darker-looking patches of water called `cat's paws`. Similar gusts over pastures and grain crops can cause wavy fields of grain.

#### Hazards

Deeper cumuliform clouds have stronger updrafts.

* The deepest ones, `cumulus congestus` and `thunderstorms`, have such violent updrafts that can be a hazard to aircraft.
* The strong updrafts can cause the pilot to lose control of the aircraft, or can over-stress the aircraft, causing things to break
* The medium and smaller cumulus can be flown under and through, but will cause a bumpy ride
  * be sure to have your seat belt fastened, and provide barf bags to your passengers

### Stratiform Clouds

Layer clouds, `St`, look like sheets or blankets.

* range from only 100m to 6km thick in the vertical
* have a horizontal extent of 100km to 1000km
* associated with layers in the atmosphere with different relative tempratures

When a horizontal wind moves warmer air toward cold wedge at ground level, the warm air slides up along the top surface of the cold air. This behaviour is typical of `warm fronts`. As the warm air rises, it gradually cools to the point where water vapour can condense and make clouds. Indeed, we often find stratiform clouds along warm fronts.

Stratiform clouds are classifed by their altitude, and are grouped into 3 catagories:

1. High: `cirrus` (Ci), `cirrostratus` (Cs), and `cirrocumulus` (Cc)
2. Middle: `altostratus` (As) and `altocumulus` (Ac)
3. Low: `stratus` (St) and `nimbostratus` (Ns)

![stratiform](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01a-clouds/images-01a/images-st/st-diagram-stull.png)

* As a warm front approaches you, you normally see the high clouds first. These clouds extend many hundreds of kilometers ahead of the front, so you see them about half a day before the warm front arrives. 
* Next comes the mid-level clouds, and finally the low clouds along with drizzle or light rain/snow

![warmfront-stratiform-clouds](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01a-clouds/images-01a/images-st/warm-front-clouds.png)

#### Stratus vs. Nimbostratus

They both have low cloud bases, and by eye appear equally dark. 

1. But `nimbostratus` clouds are precipitating (snow, mist, drizzle, or light rain), while `stratus` is not.
2. `nimbostratus` clouds often have diffuse cloud bases, while `stratus` clouds often have well defined cloud bases.

#### Hazards

Flying through stratiform clouds is often a smooth ride because they are not usually turbulent. But, inside any cloud, including stratiform clouds, pilots need to be flying on instruments because they cannot see the ground or landmarks.

If the stratiform clouds are cold enough (at temperatures just below freezing), ice can form on the leading edges of the aircraft due to the quick freezing of supercooled liquid water drops.

Also, soarplane pilots usually don't like stratiform clouds because they shade the ground and prevent thermal updrafts from forming.

### Stratocumulus

The don't fit well in the normal cumuliform or stratiform groups, and they have characteristics of both groups.

## Special Clouds

### Clouds in unstable air aloft

#### Castellanus

**Summary**: Look like small castle turrets.

* are a clue that the atmosphere is becoming unstable
* thunderstorms possible later in the day
* bumpy if you are flying the that cloud layer
* but smooth air above and below it

![castellanus-clouds](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01b-special-clouds/images-01b/images-castellanus/cas5.jpg)
A thin layer of cold air will form above a thin layer of warm air. This combination of layers are said to be `statically unstable`:

* As the warm air rises and the cold air sinks within this warm-cold-air sandwich, mineature convective clouds form in the rising air if enough water vapour is present.
* These clouds look like castle turrets, which is how they get their name `castellanus`.
* Sometimes they form out of the top of a layer of clouds, hence, they are a type of `stratiform cloud`.
* Their diameter is small, compared to their altitude above ground.
* The convective circulations of these clouds do not touch the ground
  * instead are contained within that warm-cold-air sandwich layer.

Castellanus clouds can form as:

* high-altitude clouds
  `cirrus castellanus`, or `cirrocumulus castellanus`
* mid-altitude clouds
  `altocumulus castellanus`
* low-altitude clouds
  `stratocumulus castellanus`

##### Tips for Pilots

* Instrument-rated pilots should avoid flying in a layer of castellanus clouds.
  * as it would likely be turbulent
* If you accidentally find yourself in a layer of castellanus cloud, usually climbing or descending a small distance will get you out of the layer of turbulence.
* Pilots can use these clouds as a clue that the atmosphere contains some instability, which can allow thunderstorms to form more easily later in the day.
  * Storm chasers like castellanus clouds for this reason
  * But a layer of castellanus clouds does not guarantee that thunderstorms will form later.
* These clouds are of little use to sailplane pilots, because sustained updrafts are not often found in the clear air below these clouds.

#### Billow (K-H wave) clouds

**Summary**:

* indicate `wind shear` and `clear-air turbulence (CAT)` at aircraft altitudes
  * wind shear: change of wind speed or direction
  * clear-air turbulence (CAT): moderate to strong bumps
* smoother air is often above and below the layer of billow clouds

![k-h-wave-clouds](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01b-special-clouds/images-01b/images-billow/billow1.jpg)

Wind shear in the atmosphere can cause waves to form in a layer of air where cooler air underlies warmer air. These waves are called `Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) waves`.

* do not need mountains to form
* waves have relatively short wavelengths and are relatively thin
* probably occur very often in the atmosphere, but visible only rarely
  * visible when the rising cool air is relatively humid
  * under the correct conditions, parallel bands of clouds form in the crest of each wave.
  * to a viewer on the ground, these parallel bands of clouds look like billows of an accordion
* the waves often break, causing that cloud layer to become turbulent
* while the waves are breaking, cat's eye swirls form, some of which are even visible on radar
* Pilots prefer to avoid flying at these altitudes because of the turbulence induced by wind shear.

Because these waves happen in large horizontal regions, you can often see billow clouds as a high-cloud layer, or as mid-cloud layer. (`stratiform cloud`)

### Clouds associated with strong winds across mountains

![mountain-wind](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01b-special-clouds/images-01b/Clouds-mountains.png)

#### Lenticular (mountain-wave) Clouds

**Summary**: Indicate vertical wind oscillations and possible mountain-wave turbulence.

* sailplanes like the updraft portion of the waves
  * because they can surf the wave and fly very long horizontal distances
* commercial aircraft hate the waves because they often mean a very bumpy ride at all altitudes for the whole time while flying over the mountains.

These clouds form in the crests of `mountain waves (lee waves)` if the air is relatively humid. If there are several humid layers of air at different altitudes, then you can se a stack of lenticular clouds that look like stacked dinner plates, or like UFOs (flying saucers).

* in a nutshell, if winds hit mountains, then the air is forced to rise over the mountain.
* on the downwind (lee) side, the air returns back down to its starting altitude.
* but due to inertia, it overshoots further down, and then overshoots up again, etc.
* the air is carried downwind while it is oscillating, so it traces the path of waveã€‚

In the upward-moving portion of the wave, the air cools to the point where clouds form. But when the air descends back down the lee side of the wave, the air warms and the clouds evaporate. Thus, these clouds are weird because they remain stationary relative to the mountain while the wind blows through the cloud. 

For this reason, the clouds are often known as `standing lenticular clouds` because they stand still over the mountain. This is one of the few types of cloud that you can fly through sideways in an airplane, as the wind blows the aircraft into and then out of the cloud.

For the first wave, which is over the mountain, the lenticular cloud is often called a `cap cloud`, because it is like a hat or cap on the mountain.

* Pilots flying across these waves experience updrafts and then downdrafts
  * so it takes more effort to maintain a constant flight altitude.
* But if conditions are right, these waves can cause severe mountain wave turbulence, from the earth's surface all the way up into the stratosphere.
* For the gentler waves, sailplane pilots seek the upwind side of the lenticular clouds because they can have nearly continuous updrafts there.

#### Rotor Clouds

**Summary**: Indicate severe or extreme turbulence at low altitudes due to mountain waves.

* The rotors can break off aircraft wings and cause pilots to lose control of their aircraft during take-off and landing.
* Can also affect sailors if the rotors occur over water (lakes or coastal regions) downwind of mountains.

`Rotor clouds` are turbulent, ragged-looking clouds that form at low altitude under the crests of mountain waves. They rotate about a horizontal axis parallel to the mountain range.

* They are associated with violent turbulence that can break wings off of aircraft
* their strong up- and down-drafts can cause pilots of small aircraft to crash while attempting to land and take off.

#### Banner Clouds
**Summary**: Form on downwind side of mountain peak. Indicate strong turbulence touching the downwind side of a tall, isolated mountain peak.

### Clouds formed by extra heat, updrafts, or tubulence

#### Pyrocumulus

`cumulus flammagenitus`

**Summary**: Form over forest fires and volcanoes. Indicate a forest fire so strong that the heat and moisture released can make a thunderstorm in the smoke.

#### Pileus

**Summary**: Form over fast-growing cumulus clouds. Interesting to watch, but they are harmless, and don't affect flying, sailing or snow sports.

#### Fractus / scud

**Summary**: Form in turbulent humid air near the ground. These scud clouds indicate high humidity (such as due to drizzle falling from higher clouds) and strong winds at low altitude.

### Clouds fored by humans (i.e., homogenitus)

![homogenitus](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01b-special-clouds/images-01b/Clouds-anthropogenic-others.png)

#### Fumulus

`cumulus homogenitus`

**Summary**: Water-droplet clouds over cooling towers. Interesting to see, though harmless for flying, sailing, or snow sports.

#### Contrails

`cirrus homogenitus`

**Summary**: Aircraft condensation trail. Indicate the turbulent wing-tip vortices behind aircraft. Small aircraft can be flipped upside down if they accidently fly into a wing-tip vortex. Military pilots hate contrails, because they reveal the aircraft to the enemy.

## Cloud Coverage

Pilots flying visually, `VFR`, must stay outside of clouds. Even those flying in instruments, `IFR`, are concerned if there is a low overcast (a low ceiling) over their destination airport. For this reason, cloud coverage is important to pilots.

The fraction of sky covered by cloud is called `sky cover`, `cloud cover`, or `cloud amount`. It's measured in eights, `oktas`, according to the World Meteorological Organization, `WMO`.

![sky-cover](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01c-cloud_coverage/images-01c/cloud_cover_table-v2.png)

For aviation, the altitude of cloud base for the lowest cloud with coverage greater than 5 oktas is considered the `ceiling`. (i.e. lowest `broken` or `overcast` clouds).

Sometimes the sky is `obscured`, meaning that there might be clouds but the observer on the ground cannot see them. For obscurations, the `vertical visibility` (VV) distance is reported as a ceiling instead.

The cloudiness looks greater than it actually is when observing at oblique angles (or from the ground).

### How observers on the ground try to estimate sky cover by eye

A tricky aspect of estimating cloud cover is that lower-altitude clouds block the view of higher-altitude clouds that might or might not really be there. 

* To be conservative (i.e. extra safe), weather observers should always assume thatï¼š
  * if any clouds are visible at mid or higher levels, then clouds at those same levels are assumed to exist even if they are hidden by lower-altitude clouds.

![estimate-sky-cover](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/01-met_concepts/01c-cloud_coverage/images-01c/SkyCoverInterpretation.png)

### Cloud coverage as viewed from an aircraft

**Caution**: If you are flying at an altitude just above or just below the clouds, then in your slant or oblique view, the sky will look much more overcast than it really is. 

## Ceiling

Pilots flying according to visual flight rules need to see where they are going. But in clouds, you can't see anything â€” so VFR pilots need to stay out of clouds.

If a layer of clouds covers more than half the sky, then these clouds act like a lid or `ceiling` for VFR aviation, and constrains VFR flights to fly in the clear air below it (with some exceptions).

`ceiling` is the height `above ground level`, AGL, of the lowest cloud base.

* The cloud base is below 20000 ft (6000 m)
* and is covering more than half the sky
  * broken of overcast

Ceilings are reported as a height: e.g. the ceiling is 500 feet above ground level.

Ceiling is reported as the `vertical visibility` within that surface-based poor-visibility layer (in fog, in forest-fire smoke, in a dust storm)

Even pilots flying under instrument flight rules (IFR) are concerned with ceilings, in order to be able to land at airports.

* The reason is that most aircraft and airports are not equiped with the very expensive equipment that allows aircraft to completely land themselves using the autopilot (known as a Category IIIc approach). Instead, the IFR pilot that is descending through a cloud layer needs to pop out below the cloud base at a high enough altitude to allow sufficient time to look around, find the appropriate runway at the airport, align the aircraft with the runway, and land safely.

**Ceilings are measured with**:

* Traditional ceilometers
  Use a searchlight (ceiling projector) at an angle relative to vertical to shine on the cloud base.  Change the angle until the illuminated spot on the cloud is directly above a detector that is a known distance from the spotlight.  Then use trigonometry to calculate cloud-base height.
* Laser ceilometers
  Send up a burst of light, and measure how long it takes the light from cloud base to reflect back.
* Ceiling balloons
  Watch a red helium-filled latex balloon as it rises, record the balloon flight time until it disappears into the cloud, and then calculate the ceiling altitude based on typical rise rates of those balloons.
* Pilot reports
  Ascending planes after take-off or descending planes approaching to land can report their altitude when they passed through cloud base.
* Weather-observer estimates
  These are the worst estimates, because it is difficult to judge distance by eye, UNLESS the estimates are from tall towers or mountain tops that stick up into the clouds.

Because ceilings and visibility are so closely related, and because they are the primary considerations for whether a flight can be VFR or must be IFR, they are sometimes reported together.

* CAVOK = Ceiling and Visibility are OK (i.e. good for VFR flight)

## Visibility

If you hear the word "visibility" without any adjectives in front, then assume it is a horizontal visibility.

### Horizontal Visibility

For Canadian aviation, visibility is reported in statute miles over land, and nautical miles over the ocean. US aviation uses statute miles. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommends kilometres or metres.

If the visibility is poor, then pilots will have difficulty seeing:

* the ground, for landmarks for navigation
* other aircraft or obstacles (such as tall towers), so they don't hit them
* the horizon, to help them keep the plane flying level
* the runway at an airport, for landing

The time between when the pilot first sees an obstacle and when the aircraft hits it depends on the visibility. 

* If visibility is good and exceeds a certain threshold, then the pilot is allowed to fly under the `Visual Flight Rules` (VFR)
* when visibility is poor, only specially-trained pilots flying aircraft with special instruments can fly, on `instrument flight rules` (IFR), and following specific directions given by `air traffic control`

### Measuring Visibility

* Human observers often estimate visibility by trying to see landmarks of known distances from the airport, such as tall towers, mountains, trees, or smoke stacks.
* Some automated instruments, `ransmissometers`, shine an incident light beam across a known path length (e.g. 250 feet), and measure how much dimmer the received (transmitted*) light is compared to when the air is clean.
* Other instruments measure how much light is scattered from tiny particles in the air.

### Runway Visual Range (RVR)

Indicates how far ahead a pilot can see horizontally along a runway centerline. Reported only when visibilities are poor.

### Vertical Visibility (VV)

Vertical visibility is determined by either:

1. The distance that an observer can see vertically into an indefinite ceiling
2. The height corresponding to the top of a ceiling light projector beam
3. The height at which a ceiling balloon (a bright red balloon filled with helium) completely disappears during the presence of an indefinite ceiling
4. The height determined by the sensor algorithm at automated stations (based on horizontal visibility)

## Regulations: VFR vs. IFR

### Visual Flight
`VFR` = `Visual Flight Rules` means that you fly by mostly looking out the window. You need good visibility and need to stay out of clouds. By looking with your eyes, you can:

* navigate, so you can go toward your destination without flying through airspace where you are not allowed
* avoid hitting obstacles, such as mountains, tall towers, or other aircraft
* control the aircraft â€” namely, see whether it is climbing (nose up), descending (nose down), or turning (banked left or right)
* find airports and land on the appropriate runway

good weather for fly VFR:  `Visual Meteorological Conditions` (VMC) or `Visual Flight Conditions` (VFC)

Pilots with only VFR skills:

* are not trained to interprete and igore their balance signals from their inner ear, or their inertial feelings; the pilot loses control of the aircraft.
* lose track of where they are.
* so scared about their situation that they become irrational, they forget their emergency training, and they make poor decisions.  The result: a bad situation can become worse.

### Marginally Visual Flight

Conditions for which VFR is allowed, but for which visibility is poor and/or cloud-base is low, are called `Marginal VFR` (MVFR).

### Instrument Flight

`IFR` = `Instrument Flight Rules` mean that you can conduct most of the flight by NOT looking out the window. Instead, you:

* navigate using onboard GPS map displays and other navigation signals
* control the aircraft by looking at the instruments on your dashboard (called a "control panel" on aircraft)
*
