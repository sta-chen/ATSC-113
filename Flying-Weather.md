# Flying Weather

## Clouds

Normal clouds are classified into two categories:

* `Convective clouds` or `Cumuliform clouds` (Cu)
* `Layer clouds` or `Stratiform clouds` (St)

### Convective Clouds

Cumuliform clouds, `Cu`, look like stacks of cotton balls.

* Form when warm humid air rises through cooler surrounding air in the atmosphere.
* The buoyancy associated with the warm air drives strong updrafts

Convective clouds often have relatively flat bases that are somewhat near to the ground. However, the vertical depth of the clouds can vary significantly. Theses clouds come in 4 sizes:

1. Small: `cumulus humilis` (Cu hum) = `fair weather cumulus`
2. Medium: `cumulus mediocris` (Cu med)
3. Large: `cumulus congestus` (Cu cong) = `towering cumulus` (TCu)
4. Extra large: `cumulonimbus` (Cb) = `thunderstorms`

#### Where do they form?

Convective clouds form wherever the air near the ground is colder than the ground of ocean-surface. This can happen:

* Behind `cold fronts`
  * where a warm air mass is forced upwards by collision with a cold air mass
* On mostly clear days when sunshine warms the ground more than the overlying air
* Over urban and industrial centers that are warmer than the surrounding rural areas
* When cold air blows over a warmer ocean or lake, or warmer land

#### Local Effects

All size cumulus clouds have an updraft that starts near ground level and extends up into the cloud all the way to the cloud top:

* birds and sailplane pilots intentionally circle in the updrafts to get a free lift to higher altitude

Between the updrafts are weaker downdrafts of clear air:

* airplane and helicopter pilots flying at a constant altitude belown cloud base would feel a bumpy ride as they fly through the up- and down-drafts.

At the earth's surface, the downdrafts of air hitting the ground cause windgusts that sailors can see as slightly rougher, darker-looking patches of water called `cat's paws`. Similar gusts over pastures and grain crops can cause wavy fields of grain.

#### Hazards

Deeper cumuliform clouds have stronger updrafts.

* The deepest ones, `cumulus congestus` and `thunderstorms`, have such violent updrafts that can be a hazard to aircraft.
* The strong updrafts can cause the pilot to lose control of the aircraft, or can over-stress the aircraft, causing things to break
* The medium and smaller cumulus can be flown under and through, but will cause a bumpy ride
  * be sure to have your seat belt fastened, and provide barf bags to your passengers

### Stratiform Clouds

Layer clouds, `St`, look like sheets or blankets.

* range from only 100m to 6km thick in the vertical
* have a horizontal extent of 100km to 1000km
* associated with layers in the atmosphere with different relative tempratures

When a horizontal wind moves warmer air toward cold wedge at ground level, the warm air slides up along the top surface of the cold air. This behaviour is typical of `warm fronts`. As the warm air rises, it gradually cools to the point where water vapour can condense and make clouds. Indeed, we often find stratiform clouds along warm fronts.

Stratiform clouds are classifed by their altitude, and are grouped into 3 catagories:

1. High: `cirrus` (Ci), `cirrostratus` (Cs), and `cirrocumulus` (Cc)
2. Middle: `altostratus` (As) and `altocumulus` (Ac)
3. Low: `stratus` (St) and `nimbostratus` (Ns)

* As a warm front approaches you, you normally see the high clouds first. These clouds extend many hundreds of kilometers ahead of the front, so you see them about half a day before the warm front arrives. 
* Next comes the mid-level clouds, and finally the low clouds along with drizzle or light rain/snow

#### Stratus vs. Nimbostratus

They both have low cloud bases, and by eye appear equally dark. 

1. But `nimbostratus` clouds are precipitating (snow, mist, drizzle, or light rain), while `stratus` is not.
2. `nimbostratus` clouds often have diffuse cloud bases, while `stratus` clouds often have well defined cloud bases.

#### Hazards

Flying through stratiform clouds is often a smooth ride because they are not usually turbulent. But, inside any cloud, including stratiform clouds, pilots need to be flying on instruments because they cannot see the ground or landmarks.

If the stratiform clouds are cold enough (at temperatures just below freezing), ice can form on the leading edges of the aircraft due to the quick freezing of supercooled liquid water drops.

Also, soarplane pilots usually don't like stratiform clouds because they shade the ground and prevent thermal updrafts from forming.

### Stratocumulus

The don't fit well in the normal cumuliform or stratiform groups, and they have characteristics of both groups.

## Special Clouds

### Clouds in unstable air aloft

#### Castellanus

A thin layer of cold air will form above a thin layer of warm air. This combination of layers are said to be `statically unstable`:

* As the warm air rises and the cold air sinks within this warm-cold-air sandwich, mineature convective clouds form in the rising air if enough water vapour is present.
* These clouds look like castle turrets, which is how they get their name `castellanus`.
* Sometimes they form out of the top of a layer of clouds, hence, they are a type of `stratiform cloud`.
* Their diameter is small, compared to their altitude above ground.
* The convective circulations of these clouds do not touch the ground
  * instead are contained within that warm-cold-air sandwich layer.

Castellanus clouds can form as:

* high-altitude clouds
  `cirrus castellanus`, or `cirrocumulus castellanus`
* mid-altitude clouds
  `altocumulus castellanus`
* low-altitude clouds
  `stratocumulus castellanus`

##### Tips for Pilots

* Instrument-rated pilots should avoid flying in a layer of castellanus clouds.
  * as it would likely be turbulent
* If you accidentally find yourself in a layer of castellanus cloud, usually climbing or descending a small distance will get you out of the layer of turbulence.
